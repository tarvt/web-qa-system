# Web Content Smart Extraction and Question Answering System

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to design and implement a system that can take a website URL (e.g., a documentation page or a blog post), extract and structure its content, and store it in a way that can be used to answer textual questions in later stages.

### Project Stages:

**1. Content Extraction**
- The system should receive multiple URLs.
- It must extract the textual content, focusing on sections containing useful information.
- The extracted content should be saved in a structured format (e.g., in a database or file).

**2. Data Preparation for Q&A**
- The data should be prepared in a way that allows for searching and retrieval based on semantic similarity or contextual relevance.
- The user should not have to wait for the entire extraction and preparation process to finish for a given URL before they can input the next one. This implies an asynchronous process.

**3. Question Answering**
- Design a system that receives a textual question.
- Based on the stored data, it should select the most relevant section(s).
- The text of the selected section(s) should be displayed to the user.
